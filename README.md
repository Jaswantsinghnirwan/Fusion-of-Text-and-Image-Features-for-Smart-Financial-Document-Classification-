Fusion of Text and Image Features for Smart Financial Document Classification
üìå Overview

This project implements a multimodal deep learning model to classify financial documents such as balance sheets, cash flow statements, income statements, tax forms, and notes.
It combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for robust feature extraction, achieving 90.9% accuracy.

The system reduces manual document processing, minimizes errors, and has strong potential for real-time deployment in financial institutions.

‚ö° Features

Automated classification of financial documents.

Text preprocessing with NLTK and spaCy (tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal).

Embeddings with Word2Vec / TF-IDF for semantic understanding.

OCR-based text extraction for scanned documents.

Data augmentation & SMOTETomek for class imbalance handling.

Deep learning model with Bidirectional LSTM trained using TensorFlow/Keras.

Achieved 90.9% accuracy on benchmark dataset.
